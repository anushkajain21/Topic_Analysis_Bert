# Topic_Analysis_Bert

**Introduction**

In this project, A model was developed that can predict a comment's topic category scraped from an online platform. The data of this project contains comments related to 40 categories. I decided to experiment with deep learning models and state-of-the-art techniques given the problem statement. I have used BERT for this problem.
